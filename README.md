# Spaghetti Factory

Can we load Forge mods within Fabric? Hmm. Probably not. Let's see. Don't get your hopes up.

## TODO

* continue working on remapping jars
  * actually _performing_ the remapping process uses a different equality test than for inverting/chaining mappings
    * (name alone, vs. name and owner)
  * impl tiny and yarn Mappings
* lol all the other stuff too
  * infinite forge mixins
  * caching remapped products
  * auto-downloading joined.tsrg (grab it from mcpconfig on maven i guess?)
